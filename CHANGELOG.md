## [v0.4.0] - 2025-04-08

Another yet-again long-awaited release! ðŸ¥³

As per the title, this mostly includes features, but also includes the usual bug fixes, documentation updates, and maintenance chores.

### Features

##### Add ability to disable sourcing of particular `.env` files

When `cd`ing to a directory with an `.env` (by default) file, `autoenv` used to _always prompt_ to source the file:

```console
$ cd ./dir
autoenv: WARNING:
autoenv: This is the first time you are about to source /home/edwin/autoenv/.hidden/.env:
autoenv:
autoenv:   --- (begin contents) ---------------------------------------
autoenv:     echo '.env has been sourced.'$
autoenv:
autoenv:   --- (end contents) -----------------------------------------
autoenv: Are you sure you want to allow this? (y/N)
```

Even when selecting `n` (no), autoenv would not remember that choice. Now, there is a new option!:

```console
$ AUTOENV_VIEWER=cat cd ./dir
[autoenv] New or modified env file detected:
--- Contents of ".env" --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
echo '.env has been sourced.'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[autoenv] Authorize this file? (y/n/d)
```

Choose `d` (disable) if you no longer want any "source prompts" for this file. Note that if the file content changes, then your choice is reset and `autoenv` will prompt you yet again.

The `AUTOENV_NOTAUTH_FILE` shell variable is used to configure where this data is stored. Its format is identical to the one in `AUTOENV_AUTH_FILE`.


##### Improve the default `.env` output and support customizing the printer

As you may have noticed in the above example, the prompt has been upgraded to read better, when `AUTOENV_VIEWER` is set to a non-empty variable.

By default, `autoenv` will use the old authorization prompt to reduce disruption for current users that are used to the old prompt. Opt-in by setting `AUTOENV_VIEWER` to a non-empty value, like `cat`. Another good value is `less -N`.

Thanks to @alissa-huskey! (#206)

##### Supports the XDG Base Directory Specification

The [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://xdgbasedirectoryspecification.com) is now adhered to. Some details:
- On a fresh install, both `AUTOENV_AUTH_FILE` and `AUTOENV_NOTAUTH_FILE` are written under `$HOME/.local/state/autoenv`
- If `AUTOENV_AUTH_FILE` is already written under `$HOME`, then the new `AUTOENV_NOTAUTH_FILE` will also be written under there for consistency
- For maximum backwards-compatability, files are not moved to the new location; the old locations can still be used

##### Document useful variables

Before invoking your shell script, `autoenv` sets the following _environment variables_:

- `AUTOENV_CUR_FILE` - The file being sourced
- `AUTOENV_CUR_DIR` - Equivalent to `dirname "$AUTOENV_CUR_FILE"`

These were added a while back in 988723d2e1f5d905e9fcedee7e236a3855185ad5, but were undocumented. Besides convenience, documenting it allows users to be confident that the feature will not be removed. I have also added the checking of these values to the test suite.

##### Prevent overriding `cd` with `AUTOENV_PRESERVE_CD`

By default, `autoenv` runs:

```console
cd() {
	autoenv_cd "${@}"
}
```

This would override any pre-existing `cd` function, making it a bit annoying to work around if a custom `cd` function is desired (and defined before `autoenv` is evaluated).

Now, set `AUTOENV_PRESERVE_CD` to a non-empty string to prevent this behavior. `autoenv_cd` will still be exposed for invocation in custom `cd` functions.

### Fixes

##### Path prefix match accounts for path boundaries

Before, when cding from a/b to a/bz, a/b/.env.leave would not be sourced. Path matching did not use forward slashes as a "cutoff" when testing if directories are different. Now, in the aforementioned situation, the file is properly sourced.

Thanks to @tomtseng! (#238)

##### Fix `.env.leave` when sourcing from a subdirectory

Let's say there exists the following directory structure:

```text
~/project/.env
~/project/.env.leave
~/project/src
```

If the current directory is `~/project/src`, and `cd /` is invoked, `.env.leave` was previously not executed. Now it is.

Thanks to @pashaosipyants! (#211)

##### Fix paths when installing through npm

The npm installation instructions included an incorrect installation path, which would lead to errors if followed. Now, it includes the correct paths.

Thanks to @wesleycoder! (#234)

And some less noticable, but still notable improvements:

- Improve installation instructions
  - Made instructions more clear for the different operating systems and shells
  - Add automated install script under scripts/install.sh
  - Add documentation for uninstalling and updating
- Various refactoring
- Implement some tests in Bats
